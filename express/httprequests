how to make http requests
    main keywords 
        get - the keyword which is used to "get" the information or the data from the server
        post - the keyword which is used to "send" the information to the server
        put - the keyword which is used to "update" the information or the data on the sever
        patch - the keyword which is used to "patch up" the data on the server
        delete - the keyword which is used to delete the information
        example :
            ordered a bicycle from amazon
            1 wheel is broken
                two options are :
                    1. put request to replace with a completely new bicycle
                    2. patch request to replace just the broken wheel
